<strong>FOR PEACE</strong></h1>
<h3><em>Saturday, September 9 at 6:00 PM</em><br />
<em>Frank Fenton Field at La Cienega Park</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our country struggling with ongoing racial and religious tensions, you are invited to come and embody peace for our society by walking with us in a silent peace walk led by 50 monks and nuns of Thich Nhat Hanh’s global monastic community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shall walk in such a way that each step we make becomes a realization of peace; each step becomes a prayer for peace and harmony. We shall walk together in silence, with no banners and no pickets. The walk will not be a petition addressed to anyone, nor will it be a demonstration against anyone. The walk is to unite our heart, to nurture our togetherness, and to dissipate fear and separation. It will be an actual experience of peace in ourselves and for our country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or belong to or identify with any other religious creed or peace organization, please come. If you are white, brown, black, yellow, red or any other color, please come. We shall practice together that wrong perceptions of self and others are at the foundation of separation, fear, hate, and violence. To support our country’s healing, we shall give hope that togetherness and collaboration is possible for our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peace walk will start at Frank Fenton Field at La Cienega Park and conclude in front of the Ahyra Fine Arts Theater where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk With Me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cinematic journey into the world of mindfulness of Thich Nhat Hanh and narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, will have its Los Angeles premiere that evening before playing in cinemas nationwide on September 12th. Help continue to spread Thay’s teachings on peace by visiting <a href="http://walkwithmefilm.com">walkwithmefilm.com</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Walking Meditation</strong><br />
<em>a poem by Thich Nhat Hanh</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Take my hand.<br />
We will walk.<br />
We will only walk.<br />
We will enjoy our walk<br />
without thinking of arriving anywhere.<br />
Walk peacefully.<br />
Walk happily.<br />
Our walk is a peace walk.<br />
Our walk is a happiness walk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then we learn<br />
that there is no peace walk;<br />
that peace is the walk;<br />
that there is no happiness walk;<br />
that happiness is the walk.<br />
We walk for ourselves.<br />
We walk for everyone<br />
always hand in hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Walk and touch peace every moment.<br />
Walk and touch happiness every moment.<br />
Each step brings a fresh breeze.<br />
Each step makes a flower bloom under our feet.<br />
Kiss the Earth with your feet.<br />
Print on Earth your love and happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Earth will be safe<br />
when we feel in us enough safety.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer I attended the first mass in the Swedish Lutheran Church in years. After some beautiful singing in a gorgeous and spacious church, the minister came in, a middle-aged man in a white beard. He greeted everyone and then he asked: “How come the Church so often enter the room with it’s behind first? a bare behind?” At this moment my guard of resistance to the mass, to the service was dropped, there was something different, something so kind and open in this minister and service. He recognized and acknowledged the Church dogma and unskillfulness. In that moment there was healing in my spiritual ancestral heart. In the collective heart of all assembled it felt like a sigh of relief, here we are safe, here we are seen and cared for.</p>
<p>As a young child I was thrilled to hear stories from the Old Testament and felt both connected to and moved by the life of Jesus. I still do. The experiences I have had in Church has offered something very different. It’s like the message that was offered was something like: life is to endure, work hard to make penance and there is no way out, until death, maybe.&#8221; Toward the end of the mass we all got to turn around to offer peace and presence to the people around us in the pews.</p>
<p>Experiencing the openness, joy and care during this mass, offers me much confidence that we can all find ways to come together in a way that the preciousness and wonder of life is present.</p>
<p>When we can let go of all or at least some of our worries, concerns, judgements and comparisons, the present moment starts to reveal itself. We are more collected and centered. We are more together within ourselves and with the people around us, this is awakening in itself. This is a moment of partial awakening to non-self, to interbeing. In this moment there is healing taking place, individually and collectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1513" src="http://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-200x300.jpg" alt="Chan Phap Ho at the Big Bell in Deer Park Monastery" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-40x60.jpg 40w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho-57x85.jpg 57w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chan-phap-ho.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>In my practice and study, I am most interested to look into what are the wounds in me and in the collective which limits our peace, love and freedom. Recognizing and taking care of this pain and blockage is necessary for healing and thus awakening to take place. The theme for this tour inspires me especially now when it can be easy to be overwhelmed with the troubles and complexities of our society and the world. More than ever do I sense the importance to offer ourselves to the path Mahatma Gandhi offered us: <em>be the change you want to see in the world</em>. We cannot do this as individuals, because separation and conflict is perpetuating the troubles we are in.</p>
<p>As we practice walking meditation in nature we can heal our separation from the Earth. As we eat together we can come to see all of humanity as our family. As we consume less and enjoy a plant based diet our solidarity for those less fortunate can deepen. As we practice the Five Mindfulness Trainings and Noble Silence we can mature in our practice of peace and non-harming. What a wonderful way to spend a week. I hope you can join us. With many experienced practitioners and many newcomers, we can inspire each other to fully live and practice during the retreat, in this way we Awaken Together and Heal our Ancestral Heart. This healing will ripple much further than the retreat center.</p>

<p>in the eternal chorus of the ocean singing to the cliff,<br />
in the silent whisper of the stones,<br />
in the coyote howling to the moon,<br />
in the twinkling eyes of children,<br />
in your beloved&#8217;s hand holding yours,<br />
in the smile of a stranger,<br />
in the good, the true the beautiful that one can witness all over the planet&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8230;the question is, am I quiet and still enough to recognize and hear it?</p>
<p>Stop..and listen.</p>
<p>To recognize the presence of those around us is an act of Love..<br />
&#8230;an act of Love we that we can perform everyday.</p>
<p>Let us take some time to perform this miracle and write (at least!) one Love Letter to a family member, a friend, a politician, ourselves.. to recognize and celebrate the gifts their bring to life.<br />
And do send it to them!</p>
<p>Here is a letter our teacher wrote to the Earth..</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mother Earth,</p>
<p>I recognize that you are present in me and that I am a part of you.<br />
It is from you that I have been born, and you who are always present, offering me everything I need for my nourishment and growth.</p>
<p>It is your fresh air that we breathe, your clear water that we drink, your nourishing food that we eat, and your medicinal herbs that heal us when we are sick.</p>
<p>You have all the qualities of a mother. You are nothing less than the Mother of all Beings.<br />
I call you by the human name Mother, and yet I know your mothering nature is more vast and ancient than humankind.<br />
We are just one young species of your many children. All the millions of other species who live–or have lived–on Earth are also your children.</p>
<p>You are not a person, but I know you are not less than a person either.<br />
You are a Great Being, not in the form of a human, but in the form of a planet–a living, breathing being. Each species has its own language, yet as our Mother you can understand us all.<br />
That is why you can hear me today. That is why I can open my heart to you and offer you my prayer.</p>
<p>You are present in every cell of my body. My physical body is your physical body, and just as the Sun and stars are present in you, they are also present in me. You are not outside of me and I am not outside of you.<br />
<strong>You are more than just my environment. You are nothing less than myself.</strong></p>
<p>I promise to keep the awareness alive that you are always in me, and I am always in you.<br />
I promise to be aware that your health and wellbeing is my own health and wellbeing.<br />
I know I need to keep this awareness alive in me for us both to be peaceful, happy, healthy, and strong.</p>
<p>But sometimes I forget. Lost in the confusions and worries of daily life, I forget that my body is your body, and sometimes even forget that I have a body at all.</p>
<p>Unaware of the presence of my body and the beautiful planet around me and within me, I am unable to cherish and celebrate the precious gift of life you have given me.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, it is my deep wish to wake up to the miracle of life. I promise to train myself to be present for myself, my life and for you in every moment.</p>
<p>I know that my true presence is the best gift I can offer you, the one I love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please join us this fall on the #AwakeningTogether tour in New York, California, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Mississippi.</p>

<p><em>&#8221; &#8230;is something that speaks of Sangha,</em><br />
<em> the beloved community when we come together</em><br />
<em> and share our joys &amp; sorrows.</em><br />
<em> We awaken as one, together.</em><br />
<em> It also is broad enough to invite people to come as they are, with what is present, as this will be held in community&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Awakening Together&#8230;</h2>

<h2>practice mindful thought and action</h2>

<h2>we need to *remember*</h2>
<h2>our ancestors&#8217; presence and guidance</h2>
<h2>in this journey.</h2>
<h2>And ancestors can be from blood and chosen</h2>

Awakening Together&#8230;</h1>
<p>&#8230;is gaining insight into a reality that one may not be previously<br />
conscious of. And &#8220;Awakening together&#8221; makes me think that this will<br />
be a joint community effort, so there is no room for &#8220;feeling separate&#8221;<br />
but rather &#8220;we&#8217;re on this together&#8221; type of ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Thank you to those who have offered these reflections above. &#8220;Awakening Together&#8230;what comes alive in you when you hear this? What shapes, sounds, colors, taste does it take in your own life? Do share with us in words, music, pictures, painting, dancing&#8230;anything really&#8230;so as to inspire each other on this journey that we walk together&#8230;<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join the monastic community founded, ordained, and trained by Thich Nhat Hanh as they <a href="https://tnhtour.org/tour-dates/">tour the United States</a> to continue the legacy of the beloved Zen master. Join us for retreats and days of mindfulness to learn the art of mindfulness and bring collective awakening and healing to our family, society, and the world through mediation and practicing together in community.</p>
<p><em><strong>Awakening Together, Healing the Ancestral Heart&#8230;</strong></em><br />
When sharing this theme with a friend, an elder from an Alaskan tribe, she said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pffffiou&#8230;if we can do that now&#8230;.what an offering to the people who&#8217;ll come at the retreat!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Her words engraved themselves in my cells, like a koan from the Heart of the Earth&#8230;the Ancestral Heart&#8217;s whispering&#8230;.</p>
<p>So&#8230; <em><strong>Why don&#8217;t we do it now now?</strong></em></p>
<h3><a href="http://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1475" src="http://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-300x182.jpg" alt="Sitting on the Mountain" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-300x182.jpg 300w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-768x465.jpg 768w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-99x60.jpg 99w, https://tnhtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-140x85.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Awakening Together, Healing the Ancestral Heart&#8230;</h3>
<p>We are all invited to bring these words to life,<br />
to breathe them in, and see what fills our lungs&#8230;<br />
to chew them carefully and see what flavors come to our tongue,<br />
to sing them out loud and see what song comes to our ears&#8230;</p>
<p>So that they can be more than just nice words on a poster,<br />
so that they can become a living reality in our lives,<br />
so that, together, wherever we are, we can start this collective journey of Awakening,<br />
of discovering what&#8217;s the Ancestral Heart, where does it beat, and how do we heal it.</p>
<p><strong>What is coming together to nourish awakening? What&#8217;s the Ancestral Heart? How do we heal it?</strong></p>
<p>Let us take this opportunity to not wait for retreats or tours to practice but do it right here and right now. Let us sit and start the journey with this meditation.</p>
<h2>Meditation</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing In, I enjoy my in-breath.<br />
Breathing out, I enjoy my out-breath.<br />
<em>Enjoying In-breath.</em><br />
<em>Enjoying Out-breath.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing In, I become mindful of my heart beating, sending blood and new oxygen to every part of my body.<br />
Breathing out, I smile to this life, flowing inside me<br />
<em>Aware of heart beating</em><br />
<em> Smiling to life flowing through me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing In, I feel my in-breath bringing life to every cell of my body<br />
Breathing out, I feel my out-breath deepening my awareness of being alive<br />
<em>In-breath, bringing life to every cell</em><br />
<em> Out-breath, deepening my being alive</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing In, I know that my heart beating is also the heart of my ancestors, with all their dreams, joy, happiness, strength and courage<br />
Breathing out, I am determined to continue to nourish this heart for them and for me<br />
<em>My heart, the heart of my ancestors</em><br />
<em> Determined to continue their joy, courage and strength</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing In, I know that my heart beating is also the heart of my ancestors, with all their fears, sadness, hunger, anger, hatred and discrimination<br />
Breathing out, I am determined to practice to transform the afflictions of my ancestors in my own heart<br />
<em>My heart, the heart of my ancestors</em><br />
<em> Determined to transform their afflictions</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing in, I am aware of the very many hearts beating in this room right now, bringing life, blood and oxygen to many parts of the many bodies here.<br />
Breathing out, I smile to this life flowing all around me<br />
<em>Aware of very many hearts around</em><br />
<em> Smiling to life flowing all around me</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing in, I am aware that all these hearts are the hearts of many ancestors, with their joy, dreams and suffering<br />
Breathing out, I am determined to learn to embrace, accept and love all the people around me<br />
<em>Hearts around, the hearts of many ancestors</em><br />
<em> Determined to embrace, accept and love</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Breathing in, I am aware of the Heart of the Earth under and all around me, beating in the trees, rocks, grass, water, birds&#8230;<br />
Breathing out, I take refuge in the Heart of the Earth, in Her Love, Strength, Forbearance and Creativity, always bringing forth new life.<br />
<em>Aware of the Heart of the Earth</em><br />
<em> Taking refuge in the Earth</em></p>
