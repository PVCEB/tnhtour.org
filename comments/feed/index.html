					<description><![CDATA[I have long noticed the lack of attention in this prominent international sangha to people with disabilities. It would be wonderful if you would show an intention to welcome and encourage people with all kinds of disabilities to join in, now more than ever, as people with disabilities are so threatened and fearful due to the current political situation. And so unseen, left off almost every list of those especially at risk. We need you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so. May we have a walk in Portland Oregon, esplanade, 6pm, impromtu around the waterfront. Inwardly smiling and moved.  We shall walk together in silence, with no banners and no pickets.  The walk is to unite our heart, to nurture our togetherness, and to dissipate fear and separation. It will be an actual experience of peace in ourselves and for our country.]]></description>
